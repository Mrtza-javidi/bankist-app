# Description:
💰 This application simulates a banking application that can respond to major requests such as depositing, withdrawing, and receiving loans...

<br/>

## How To Work with?
1️⃣ - First you need to login to one of the 4 accounts specified in the JS environment. 
- The accounts' information is as follow:
   - account 1: `username: js` & `password: 1111`
   - account 2: `username: jd` & `password: 2222`
   - account 3: `username: stw` & `password: 3333`
   - account 4: `username: ss` & `password: 4444`

<br/>

2️⃣ - Then you need to keep the above information in mind in order to transfer money between the accounts 😁.
